# Driftcharge Ecommerce Glossary â€” Abandoned Cart

**Abandoned cart** happens when a shopper adds items to the cart but leaves before completing checkout. Itâ€™s one of the biggest leaks in ecommerce.

## Why it happens
- Unexpected shipping/fees
- Slow or confusing checkout
- Distractions or site speed issues

## How to recover
- Personalized reminder emails with a direct cart link
- Small incentive (e.g., 10% off / free shipping) on a timer
- Exit-intent popups before visitors leave
- Streamlined, trust-rich checkout (guest checkout + badges)
